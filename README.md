# Maths3D
 
I'm using this project to learn mathematics from the book "Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics" (3rd edition) written by Eric Lengyel, published by Cengage Learning.

I'm not trying to do any optimization or to build any robust architecture here, I just write the way I find the most convenient because the real subject here is math, not C++.
